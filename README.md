# Memory Puzzle using Python and Tkinter

This is a memory puzzle game implemented using Python and the Tkinter library. The game displays a grid of tiles, and the objective is to find and match pairs of tiles with the same number. The game board is hidden initially, and the player needs to click on tiles to reveal them. If two revealed tiles have the same number, they remain visible. Otherwise, they are hidden again, and the player continues to search for matching pairs until all tiles are revealed.

## Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. This code is compatible with Python 3. Additionally, the Turtle graphics module is required, which is typically included with the Python installation.

## Installation

1. Create a new Python file and save it with a `.py` extension (e.g., `memory_puzzle.py`).
2. Ensure that the `turtle` module is available by default with your Python installation. If not, you may need to install it using pip:

```bash
pip install PythonTurtle
```

## Usage

To play the memory puzzle game:

1. Open the Python file (`memory_puzzle.py`) in a text editor or IDE.
2. Run the script using Python.

The game window will appear, showing a grid of tiles. Click on the tiles to reveal them. If two tiles have the same number, they will remain visible. If not, they will be hidden again. Keep revealing tiles and finding matching pairs until all tiles are revealed.

## Customization

Feel free to customize the game according to your preferences. You can modify the colors, tile sizes, font styles, or add additional functionality as desired.
